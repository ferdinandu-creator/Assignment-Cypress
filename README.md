# Guide

We have already setup a few things upfront for you since the `Login` to the platform part can be time consuming.

Feel free to make any changes to this codebase you believe they are necessary and/or fit your needs

In this assignment we expect you to use `cypress`.

`typescript` is already set up in this project but if you are not confortable using it you can just use plain `javascript`, make sure that the files extension is `.ts` in order for the `specs` to run.

We understand that you might have questions before you start the assignment. Please ask your recruiter to set up an online meeting with a QA engineer from Stitch in order to help you.

# The assignment

**Configuration**

You will need to fill in the `AUTH_USERNAME` and the `AUTH_PASSWORD` in the `cypress.env.json`, they will be provided to you alongside this assignment. If you don't have them please ask your recruiter.

**Installation**

In your terminal do the following:

- `yarn` to install the necessary packages
- `yarn cypress:open` to start the Cypress Suite
- `yarn cypress:run` to run the Cypress tests in headless mode

_Note:_ if you are more familiar with `npm` feel free to use that instead of `yarn`.

**Objectives**

- Spec 1: Use `cypress` to Create a new Presentation. You can find the _Create Presentation Form_ by clicking the (+) at the bottom right corner of the screen you landed when you run `yarn cypress:open`. Make sure that the Presentation has been successfully created. Extra points: make sure the Form validation works as expected.
- Spec 2: Use `cypress` to filter the _Presentations List_ to show results from `All` Users and the presentations name contain the word `bot`. Make sure that the number of items that the server responded with are actually rendered in the page.
- Did you find any bugs? Please write up in a _markdown_ file what you found and what would you do to improve QA.

**When finished**

- Push the code of this assignment to a `GitHub` or `GitLab` repository if possible, otherwise you could just remove the `node_modules` and send us a `.zip` file.
- Give access to `sakiskatsikas` in case of `GitHub` OR `.Sakis` in case of `GitLab`.
